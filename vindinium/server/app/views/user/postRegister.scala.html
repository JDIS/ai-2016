@(user: User)

@main("Registration successfull") {

<h1>"@user.name" successfully registered</h1>

<p>
  This is your user key:
</p>
<p id="user-key">
    <strong>@user.key</strong>
</p>

  Keep it secret. You will need it as an API parameter
  to authenticate your AI with the server.
</p>

<p>
  If you forget your key, you're screwed. There is no recovery.

  Copy the key, then <a href="@routes.User.show(user.id)">Proceed to your user page</a>.
</p>
}
